# SFML-Basketball

SFML Basketball were one point my unversity Box2D project. 
This project is now refactored and make alive with neccessary dll to ensure it can run easily. However, the gameplay or design is subjected to change as the key goal is demonstrate code intergration, less on "is it fun".

Assets are mostly internet sourced, and they were used as "educational purposes". Please beware of copyright issues.

There is an existing Box2D.lib submitted along the project. Follow the documentation and build Box2D.lib if you wish to rebuild. Remember to setup them again inside Solution Properties. I submit DLL because I found out their build flow is not very straight forward to me.

You can only build x64 due to Box2D and SFML combined.

Feel free to reference or contributes changes.
